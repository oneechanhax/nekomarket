# nekomarket
A distributed/decentralized game market using blockchain

THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND IN PROGRESS!!!

## POC
ITs kinda like bisq but instead of crypto, its ingame items. For example, you can see item id's in tf2. you can then send it to someone else, now u dont have an item with that id and they do. verify that. it relys on game servers for verification, but u have to rely on them anyways so whats the loss /shrug

### Donors
have currency "donors". Donors supply(invest) currency like keys, for each amount given it is registered in the blockchain, request currency back and the network supplies it back with interest(network costs) for using that money. Donors cannot be miners as they shouldnt control things based on wealth alone???

TODO: should donors be miners? doesnt the transactions build into a block that needs to entirely be mined? maybe when u complete a block, you send a notification and proof of completion, then once its accepted you start sending your money out to needed recipients, send proof, get verifyed, then you can safely request that money back and the network should accept it if its currect information. in the end, you get to ask for more than what u put in.

### Miners
Miners are still the backbone of any crypto. they are used to command the donors on where their money should go. does it go to e
